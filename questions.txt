introduce yourself

explain project architecture

what was the difficult task which you handled in ur last project?

we have an array 
	var bdays = ['08-14', '10-04', '04-21'];
	
	we want a new array where the birthdays will be in the format: MM/DD. solove this without for loop.
	hint: array has different methods

we have an array 
	var arr = [1.5, 2.56, 5.1, 12.33];
	
	round each number up in an array. solove this without for loop.

we have an array
	var arr = [1,2,3,1,4,5];
	
	find duplicates. solve using array methods.

write a function to create a new array of only positive values
	var nums = [-4, 3, 2, -21, 1]; slove using array methods

write a function to reverse an array of strings.

Write a function that would allow you to do this.
	var addSix = createBase(6);
	addSix(10); // returns 16
	addSix(21); // returns 27
	
How would you use a closure to create a private counter?
